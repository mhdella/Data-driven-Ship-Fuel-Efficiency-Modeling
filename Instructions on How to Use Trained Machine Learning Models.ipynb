    "***Acknowledgement***. This is the software infrastructure of ***the IAMU (International Association of Maritime Universities) research project titled “Data fusion and machine learning for ship fuel efficiency analysis: a small but essential step towards green shipping through data analytics” (Research Project No. 20210205_AMC). The materials and data in this project have been obtained through the support of IAMU and The Nippon Foundation in Japan***. This project has the following investigators: Yuquan (Bill) Du (Coordinator, Lead Applicant), Peggy Shu-Ling Chen, Nataliya Nikolova, Prashant Bhaskar, and Jiangang Fei from University of Tasmania (UTAS); Alessandro Schönborn from World Maritime University (WMU) as WMU-side Chief Investigator; and Zhuo Sun from Dalian Maritime University (DMU) as DMU-side Chief Investigator. Dr Xiaohe Li laid a good Python code fundation during his University Associate role at UTAS and conducted some preliminary experiments. Ms Yanyu Chen is the major Research Assistant of this project who has major contributions to Python code and conducting experiments under the supervision of Dr Yuquan (Bill) Du. Mr Jean-Louis Bertholier developed the Python code of collecting meteorological data for ships during his Assistant Engineer internship at World Maritime University. Warm help are received from ECMWF (Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts) and Copernicus Marine Service (CMEMS) when we wanted to automate the download process of meteorological data. This study has been conducted using E.U. Copernicus Marine Service Information; https://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00050. Hersbach et al. (2018) was downloaded from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) Climate Data Store. The results of this study and trained machine learning models published contain modified Copernicus Climate Change Service information 2020. Neither the European Commission nor ECMWF is responsible for any use that may be made of the Copernicus information or data it contains.\n",
